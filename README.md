# Data-Science-Mentorship-Program-2.0

This repository is dedicated to my solutions of tasks and all learnings delivered by CampusX for the course "DSMP-2.0"

## Structure

The Learnings are names in the format : Week-No_ > Topic-Name > SessionNo._Topic_name.ipynb

The tasks are names in the format : Week-No_ > Topic-Name > session_No._tasks.ipynb

In the solutions while solving the assignments I have also gone a bit deep by exploring the web and learning new things which are also a part in some assignments. Also, I have made notes for all the topics and a detailed repository will be made soon in a much more structured format including some pratice codes, notes, assignment questions and solutions.

All the assignments are completed using Jupyter notebook in a way I understood the concepts feel free to go through them as they cover almost the most vital topics involved during the interviews.

## Topics Covered

Below are the topics you'll find in this repository:

🔹 Python

🔹 Python Data Visualization Tools

🔹 SQL

🔹 Statistics

🔹 Machine learning

🔹 Capstone Project

## Description

👋 Welcome to the CampusX Assignments Repository!

📚 This repository contains a collection of tasks and learnings related to Python, Data Science, and Machine Learning, curated by the team at CampusX.

🚀 Our goal is to provide a comprehensive resource for those looking to improve their skills in these exciting fields. Whether you're a beginner or an expert, you'll find plenty of challenges and opportunities to learn and grow.

💻 Each assignment is accompanied by a set of instructions and sample code, designed to guide you through the task and help you develop your skills. We encourage you to experiment with the code and try out your own ideas.

📈 As you progress through the assignments, you'll build a solid foundation in Python and gain experience in using popular data science libraries such as NumPy, Pandas, and Matplotlib. You'll also explore cutting-edge topics like machine learning and artificial intelligence, learning how to build predictive models and intelligent agents.

🚀 Let's learn and grow together!

I hope you find this repository useful and informative in your journey towards mastering data science.

👨‍💻 Happy coding! 🎉

❤️ Thank you for visiting my repository, and happy exploring 🤗
